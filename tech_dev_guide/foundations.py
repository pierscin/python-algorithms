    Description:

        Given a string S and a set of words D, find the longest word in D that is a subsequence of S.

        Word W is a subsequence of S if some number of characters, possibly zero, can be deleted from S to form W,
        without reordering the remaining characters.

        Note: D can appear in any format (list, hash table, prefix tree, etc.)

        For example, given the input of S = "abppplee" and D = {"able", "ale", "apple", "bale", "kangaroo"} the correct
        output would be "apple"

        The words "able" and "ale" are both subsequences of S, but they are shorter than "apple".
        The word "bale" is not a subsequence of S because even though S has all the right letters, they are not in the
        right order.
        The word "kangaroo" is the longest word in D, but it isn't a subsequence of S.
    Args:
        S: string to search subsequence in.
        D: iterable with words.

    Returns:
        Longest subsequence of S found in D
